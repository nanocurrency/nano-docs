### Signing algorithm: ED25519

ED25519 is an elliptic curve algorithm developed in an academic setting with a focus on security from side channel attack, performance, and fixing a lot of the little annoyances in most elliptic curve systems[^1]. However, it should be noted that instead of using SHA-512 in the key derivation function, Nano uses Blake2b-512.

  ```

### Hashing algorithm: Blake2

Compared to existing cryptocurrencies, the hash algorithm chosen is much less important since it's not being used in a [Proof-of-Work](/glossary#proof-of-work-pow) context.  In Nano hashing is used purely as a digest algorithm against block contents.  Blake2b-256 is a highly optimized cryptographic hash function whose predecessor was a SHA3 finalist.[^2]

### Key derivation function: Argon2

The key derivation function of Argon2d version 1.0 is used for securing the account keys in the reference wallet. [^3]
