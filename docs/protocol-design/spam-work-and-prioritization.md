# Protocol Design - Spam, Work, & Prioritization

--8<-- "wip-living-whitepaper.md"

## Spam resistance

A spam transaction is loosely defined as a block broadcasted with the intent to saturate the network, reduce network availability, or increase the size of the ledger. In order to make spam more costly, each valid block in Nano requires a proof-of-work (PoW) solution to be attached to it - similar to the original Hashcash proposition[^1]. Participants can compute the required work in a few seconds, and verification time for this work is negligible (to prevent invalid blocks, large work, and/or invalid work from becoming a denial-of-service attack vector). The cost of spamming the network then increases linearly with the number of spam transactions, reducing the impact of spam from theoretically infinite to a manageable amount.

In addition to proof-of-work, another key component of Nano's defense against spam is transaction prioritization using a round-robin balance-bucket system, combined with least-recently-used (LRU) prioritization within those buckets. This system ensures that spam does not prevent legitimate users from making transactions & achieving fast confirmation, which in turn removes some of the incentives to spam (e.g. network disruption). See the [prioritization details](#prioritization-details) & [prioritization buckets](#prioritization-buckets) sections below for more information. While prioritization can be considered a "Node Implementation" topic, it's included in this "Protocol Design" discussion due to its relevance to spam resistance.

## Spam resistance features

Below is a list of some of Nano's key spam mitigation features.

| **Feature** | **Description** | **Version** |
| - | - | - |
| [bandwidth_limit](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/2035) | Restricts outbound bandwidth to a user-configurable limit. 10 MB/s by default. | V19+ |
| [Balance tiers (buckets)](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/3208) | As of V27, there are 63 balance tiers (buckets) that nodes rotate through in a round-robin manner. Spamming a single bucket (e.g. Ӿ0.0001) has minimal impact on accounts in other buckets (e.g. Ӿ1, Ӿ5, etc). See [prioritization details](#prioritization-details) below. | V22+ |
| [Bootstrap limits](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4158) | Configurable ascended bootstrapper limits via requests_limit, database_requests_limit, pull_count, timeout, [bootstrap_bandwidth_limit](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/blob/develop/nano/node/nodeconfig.hpp#L129-L130), [bootstrap_connections_max](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/blob/develop/nano/node/nodeconfig.hpp#L100-L101), etc. Default outbound bootstrap traffic limit is 5MB/s. Default max incoming bootstrap connections count is 64 (lower values save IOPs & bandwidth). | V25+ |
| [Bounded active election buckets](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4626) | Limits election bucket size and allows for dynamically dropping and scheduling higher priority elections. Buckets can be configured to opportunistically use more available space if AEC is underutilized. | V27+ |
| [Bounded unchecked memory table](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/3835) | Add a memory container for unchecked blocks once the initial bootstrap threshold is reached, with blocks pruned in FIFO order. Limited to two items per dependency. | V23.3+ |
| [Fair queueing](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4476) | Each peer (node) & each component (e.g. [block processor](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4476), [vote processor](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4536), [bootstrap server](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4584), [request aggregator](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4598), etc) gets its own small queue with a configurable size & priority. Nodes process these queues in a (weighted) round robin manner. This ensures that even when network is under stress, data coming from well-behaved peers is ingested quickly. | V27+ |
| [Final vote replies](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4648) | For blocks that are marked as final or confirmed, nodes will only respond with final votes (not non-final votes). This signficantly reduces network (specifically voting) traffic. | V27+ |
| [Hinted elections](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/3944) | A percentage of election slots are reserved for hinted elections, meaning that nodes start elections for transactions with a high vote weight, regardless of individual node priority. This allows the network to progress forward on confirmations, keeping the network in sync. | V24+ |
| [Hinted elections for dependencies](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4312) | The hinted election scheduler now detects cases when the node falls behind the network and is missing confirmations for block dependencies, and then activates elections for the blocks that were missed. | V26+ |
| [is_originator flag](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4654) | Adds a flag to publish messages that identifies if a block is from a node that performed the initial flooding. Helps ensure original blocks get priority over republished blocks. | V27+ |
| [Lazy bootstrapping](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/1332) | Similar to optimistic elections, but for bootstrapping. Passively listens for votes on the real-time network, and confirms block dependencies if the (more recent) block is confirmed. | V17+ |
| [Least-Recently Used (LRU) Prioritization](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/3208) | Within a given balance tier (bucket), the least-recently-used account has the highest priority. | V22+ |
| [Local block broadcaster](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4454) | Only rebroadcast blocks during active elections. Move initial block gossip responsibility to the block originator. | V27+ |
| [message_deserializer checks](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/blob/develop/nano/node/transport/message_deserializer.cpp) | Check for correct message formats before full processing (valid work, valid header, valid message type, valid version, valid network bytes (magic bytes), etc). | All |
| [Optimistic elections](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4111) | If a more recent block is confirmed, all of its dependencies are also confirmed. | V25+ |
| [Prevent requeuing of blocks with invalid signatures](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4130) | Requeueing of blocks with invalid signatures during lazy bootstrapping is not needed, since an invalid signature will always be invalid and doesn't need to be bootstrapped again. | V25+ |
| [Proof-of-Work](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/blob/develop/nano/lib/work.cpp) | Each Nano transaction requires a small Proof-of-Work. | All
| [Rep crawler overhaul](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4449#issuecomment-1968919321) | Consistently find representatives, even when vote requests are unreliable | V27+ |
| [Vote by hash](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/1025) | Instead of voting with a full block (256 bytes), representatives vote with block hashes (32 bytes), and batch these hashes. As of V27, nodes can vote for up to [255 hashes](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/4683) in a single vote. | V15+ |
| [(Future) Additional improvements](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/issues/4262) | See list of potential future improvements that have been noted for additional research. | Future |
  
## Work algorithm details

Every [block](../blocks) includes a work field that must be correctly populated. Valid work is obtained by randomly guessing a nonce such that:

$$
H(\text{nonce} || \text{x}) \ge \text{threshold}
$$

where $H$ is an algorithm, usually in the form of a hash function, $||$ is the concatenation operator, $threshold$ is a parameter of the network that relates to the resources spent to obtain a valid work, and $x$ is either:

- The account's public key, in the case of the first block on the account, or
- The previous block's hash

The following image illustrates the process by which valid work is obtained for **Block 2**.

![generate-work](../images/whitepaper/generate-work.svg)

The work field is not used when signing a block. This design has two consequences:

1. A block can be securely signed locally, while the work is requested from a remote server, with larger resources. This is especially important for devices with low resources.

2. Since all inputs are known before generating a block, a user can **precompute** the work for the next block, eliminating any time between creating and broadcasting a block. After a block is created, the next block's work can be computed immediately, using the last block's hash as input. 

## Choosing an algorithm

While the specific algorithm used is an implementation decision, there is a minimal set of requirements that must be met for compatibility with the Nano protocol.

1. Asymmetry. Verifying work should take the least amount of resources (including time) as possible.
1. Small proof size. Work should take a minimal amount of a block's size compared to the resources required to generate it, in order to reduce overhead and maximize throughput.
1. Amortization-free. The cost of obtaining work for multiple blocks should scale linearly with the number of blocks. This ensures fairness for all participants.
1. Progress-free. Any attempt at obtaining work should follow a stochastic process, with no dependence on previous attempts.

Additional requirements of parameter flexibility, constrained parallelism, and being optimization-free, are desired but not required [^2].

## Prioritization details

As of V27, Nano representatives rotate (round-robin) through 63 balance-based buckets when voting on transactions, and the least-recently-used (LRU) accounts in each bucket have the most priority (within their bucket). For example, if an account with 1 XNO and another account with 5 XNO both make two transactions, Nano representatives will vote on one transaction from the 1 XNO bucket, and one transaction from the 5 XNO bucket, before voting on a second transaction from the same bucket. Furthermore, the least-recently-used account within a bucket has the most priority (in that bucket), so after an account makes a transaction it gets moved to the back of the line behind everyone else (in that bucket). This means that if an attacker tries to send thousands of transactions from an account that only has 0.00001 Nano (for example), other accounts in the 0.00001 bucket that don't make frequent transactions will have priority over the spam, and the 0.00001 bucket spam will have no impact on accounts in other balance-buckets (e.g. 1 XNO).

!!! info "Balance-based Buckets"
	Prioritization buckets are split by _account balances_, not transaction amounts

Prior to V24, there were 129 balance buckets[^4], with the majority (89) of those buckets being for balances under 0.0003. Since most legitimate users tend to have larger balances, most of these 89 balance buckets were minimally used. In V24 this was updated to 62 balance buckets[^3][^5], & account balances under 0.0003 shared the same bucket. This created more buckets around typical real-world account balances, helping prioritize legitimate transactions over spam. V27 added an additional bucket (Ӿ0.000001 to Ӿ0.0003) to account for common wallet and faucet minimums[^6].

The following image illustrates the balance bucket & least-recently-used prioritization process:
