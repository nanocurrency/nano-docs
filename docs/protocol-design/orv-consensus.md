## Overview

### Open Representative Voting (ORV) vs Proof of Stake (PoS)

While Nano uses a weighted-voting system ([ORV](/protocol-design#orv-consensus)) that can be compared to PoS, it differs from traditional PoS because:

- There is not one monolithic blockchain that requires leader selection (i.e. a staker or a miner) to extend

- Representatives do not create or produce shared blocks (groups of transactions)

- Each Nano account has its own blockchain that only the owner can modify (representatives can only modify their own blockchain)

- In Nano, a block is a single transaction (not a group of transactions). Transactions are evaluated individually and asynchronously

- Users can remotely re-delegate their voting weight to anyone at any time

- Anyone can be a representative

- No funds are staked or locked up

- Representatives do not earn transaction fees

- Representatives cannot reverse transactions that nodes have locally confirmed (due to [block cementing](/glossary#cementing)).
