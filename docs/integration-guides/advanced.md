# Advanced Integrations

## Cold Wallets

When security of funds is critical, it is a best practice to split your balance between multiple wallets:

1. One or more **hot wallets** to handle daily user deposits/withdraws.
2. One or more **cold wallets** to securely store Nano in an offline environment.

!!! warning "Important"
	A cold wallet manages private keys that have **never** been on a network-enabled computer.

This guide extends the concepts covered in [External Private Key Management](/integration-guides/key-management/).  It is advised that you read that section before continuing.

!!! note
	Operations done on the hot, online, insecure computer will be prefaced with `(HOT)`. Operations done on the cold, offline, secure computer will be prefaced with `(COLD)`.
	
	Both the hot and cold computers need to have the nano\_node software installed. The hot nano\_node needs to be synced with the network; the cold nano\_node by definition should not be synced as it **never connects to the internet**.

---

!!! info "Cold Wallet Workflow"
	The typical work flow for a cold wallet is as follows:

	1. `(HOT)` Gather account and transaction data.
	1. Transfer this data using an offline method (e.g. via USB stick) to the `(COLD)` secure offline computer.
	1. `(COLD)` Verify Head Block hash.
	1. `(COLD)` Generate and Sign new transaction data.
	1. Transfer the signed transaction back to the `(HOT)` insecure online-computer.
	1. `(HOT)` Publish the signed transaction to the Nano Network.

### Private Key Management

The process for external private key management in a cold wallet is very similar to external private key management for a hot wallet. The primary difference is that all signing commands (and thus information containing your private key) are isolated to a clean computer with no network connection.

#### (HOT) Account Information

Get account information by the [`account_info`](/commands/rpc-protocol#account_info) RPC Command:

##### Request Example

```bash
curl -d '{
  "action": "account_info",
  "representative": "true",
  "account": "nano_3qb1qckpady6njewfotrdrcgakrgbfh7ytqfrd9r8txsx7d91b9pu6z1ixrg"
}' http://127.0.0.1:7076
```

##### Success Response

```json
{
  "frontier": "DC8EC06D1F32F97BD69BF59E3297563BD23779F72176A4FF553CFF52309C337E",
  "open_block": "2E1F5AD4BD2C840FD9DC3929ECE9EE6D0B4A8C870E45EDA11048DE91EC409165",

  "balance": "8900000000000000000000000",
  "modified_timestamp": "1524812177",
  "block_count": "105",
  "representative": "nano_3rropjiqfxpmrrkooej4qtmm1pueu36f9ghinpho4esfdor8785a455d16nf"
}
```

---

#### (HOT) Balance Validation (Part 1)

We should always assume the `(HOT)` computer has been compromised, so cannot trust the balance returned by [`account_info`](/commands/rpc-protocol#account_info). We must obtain the headblock's transaction data and independently confirm the block's hash on our `(COLD)` offline computer. On the `(HOT)` online computer, this information can be obtained by the [`block_info`](/commands/rpc-protocol#block_info) RPC Command.

##### Request Format

```bash
curl -d '{
  "action": "block_info",
  "hash": "{{HEADBLOCK}}"
}' http://127.0.0.1:7076
```

##### Request Example

```bash
curl -d '{
  "action": "block_info",
  "hash": "DC8EC06D1F32F97BD69BF59E3297563BD23779F72176A4FF553CFF52309C337E"
}' http://127.0.0.1:7076
```

      \"work\": \"5621a5a58ef8964a\"\n
    }\n"
}
```

!!! info
	Below are a few important points to remember:

	* Contents are returned as a stringified JSON object.
	* The type of the block is `"state"`. This guide only covers on how to trustlessly process `"state"` blocks on an offline computer.

Transfer the response over to the `(COLD)` computer.

---

#### (COLD) Balance Validation (Part 2)

On the `(COLD)` computer, we need to verify the block hash using the [`block_hash`](/commands/rpc-protocol#block_hash) RPC Command.. This allows us to create a safe transaction referencing the reported head block's balance.

##### Request Format

```bash
curl -d '{
  "action": "block_hash",
  "block": "<CONTENTS>"
}' http://127.0.0.1:7076
```

##### Request Example

```bash
curl -d '{
  "action": "block_hash", "block": "{\n
    \"type\": \"state\",\n
    \"account\": \"nano_3qb1qckpady6njewfotrdrcgakrgbfh7ytqfrd9r8txsx7d91b9pu6z1ixrg\",\n
    \"previous\": \"829C33C4E1F41F24F50AB6AF8D0893F484E7078F0FA05F8F56CB69223E8EEE77\",\n
    \"representative\": \"nano_3rropjiqfxpmrrkooej4qtmm1pueu36f9ghinpho4esfdor8785a455d16nf\",\n
    \"balance\": \"8900000000000000000000000\",\n
    \"link\": \"616349D5A5EBA49A73324EF29044B65E13644EC182FFC1ACA4371F897EFF22AA\",\n
    \"link_as_account\": \"nano_1rd5b9ctdtx6mbsm6mqkk34deqimej9e51qzr8pcafrzj7zhyaockuye93sk\",\n
    \"signature\": \"5058A5A1D371CE367D88DB232D398B33DF15FF95D84206986848F4165FFD9FB009B99D9DC6E90D2A3D96C639C7772497C6D6FFB8A67143AE9BB07DC49EB72401\",\n
    \"work\": \"5621a5a58ef8964a\"\n
  }\n"
}' http://127.0.0.1:7076
```

###### Success Response

```json
{ 
  "hash": "DC8EC06D1F32F97BD69BF59E3297563BD23779F72176A4FF553CFF52309C337E"
}
```

Using the responded hash on the `(COLD)` computer guarentees that the transaction we are about to create on the `(COLD)` computer will have a safe, expected outcome.

!!! warning "Important"
	Lets consider the following scenarios where malicious software on the `(HOT)` computer modifies data:

	* You are creating a send transaction.
	* Malicious software alters the `balance` field of the head block to be lower than it actually is in an attempt to get you to send too much Nano to the destination address.
	* This alters the block's hash, but the malicious software could report the honest headblock's hash.

	By independently computing the headblock's hash on the `(COLD)` computer, the generated transaction would be rejected by the network since the `previous` field references a non-existent block which is certainly not the headblock of your account.

Use the responded hash for the `previous` field in your new transaction. When computing final account balance, compute it relative to the `balance` field of the headblock on the `(COLD)` computer. Complete the rest of the [block creation as described in section External Private Key Management](/integration-guides/key-management/#send-transaction).

Once the block is created and signed on the `(COLD)` computer, transfer the contents over to the `(HOT)` computer. From the `(HOT)` computer, run the [`process`](/commands/rpc-protocol#process) RPC command to broadcast the signed transaction to the network.

!!! warning
    It is recommended to fetch the block using the hash provided in the callback rather than trust this data is valid, and check that data instead, since a malicious 3rd party can also make a fake callback request to your endpoint.

## Running Nano as a service

There are 3 different ways to enable RPC for the node:

**In process**

* `rpc.enable` = **true**
* `rpc.child_process.enable` = **false** (default, V19.0+)

**Child process**  
*V19.0+ only*

* `rpc.enable` = **true**
* `rpc.child_process.enable` = **true**
* `rpc.child_process.rpc_path` = [path to nano_rpc]
* `ipc.tcp.enable` = **true**
* `ipc.tcp.port` = `process.ipc_port` of `config-rpc.toml`

**Out of node process**  
*V19.0+ only*

* `rpc.enable` = **false**
* `rpc.child_process.enable` = **false**
* `node.ipc.tcp.enable` = **true**
* `node.ipc.tcp.port` == `process.ipc_port` of `config-rpc.toml`

The choice depends on the setup and security that you want. The easiest way is to use RPC *in_process* according to [configuration](/running-a-node/configuration)

**Launch nano_node in test mode**   

    ./nano_node --daemon --network=test

**Check if RPC is enabled with curl (use different terminal or session)**   

    curl -g -d '{ "action": "block_count" }' '[::1]:7076'

!!! tip
    If you get `curl: (7) Couldn't connect to server`, replace `[::1]:7076` with `127.0.0.1:7076`.

**To stop node, use**   

    curl -g -d '{ "action": "stop" }' '[::1]:7076'

**Launch nano_node as a service with systemd**   

    sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/nano_node.service   
    sudo chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/nano_node.service   
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/nano_node.service   

**Paste your specific user, group, path settings (example)**  
    
    [Unit]
    Description=Nano node service
    After=network.target
    
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/path_to_nano_node/nano_node --daemon
    Restart=on-failure
    User=username
    Group=groupname

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

**Start nano_node service**

    sudo service nano_node start

**Enable at startup**    

    sudo systemctl enable nano_node
    
    
!!! tip
    To manage node, use [RPC commands](/commands/rpc-protocol) or [CLI](/commands/command-line-interface)

### Known issues  

**Error initiating bootstrap ... Too many open files**

Increase max open files limit. Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` & add    
```
    *               soft    nofile          65535    
    *               hard    nofile          65535    
    root            soft    nofile          65535    
    root            hard    nofile          65535    
```
Then restart session & nano_node service. Check changes with `ulimit -n`
