# Contributing to Nano

## Running a Node

At the core of the Nano network are nodes that help manage and achieve consensus on changes to the ledger. With a variety of configuration options, nodes can be setup and tuned to participate in different processes on the network:

* Non-voting nodes can be used to follow transactions and assist other nodes with bootstrapping
* Representative nodes publish vote message which validates transactions on the network
* Principal representatives are representatives who have sufficient vote weight so the network rebroadcasts their votes to other nodes

Head over to the [Running a Node](/running-a-node/overview/) section to find out more about the different node setups.

## Building tools and services

If you're a developer and want to build using Nano you've come to the right place. Learn how [Running a Node](/running-a-node/overview/) works. If you have already started running a node, head on over to the [Integration Guides](/integration-guides/the-basics/) for some great examples that will help you in your journey. There are tons of great projects built on top of Nano: tipbots, wallets, payment processors, pay walls, payment activated hardware installations and so much more - show off what you can build!
