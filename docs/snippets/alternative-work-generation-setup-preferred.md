!!! warning "Alternative work generation setup preferred"
	Due to potential performance impacts to nodes participating on the network (voting, staying in sync, etc.), when possible this option should be updated to a value of `0` to turn off local work generation. Please see the [Work Generation guide](/integration-guides/work-generation) for best practices.
