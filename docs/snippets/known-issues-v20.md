!!! warning "Known issues with V20.0"
    
    **Windows missing `zlib1.dll`**

    * **Issue:** The following error can be seen when attempting to run a full node on Windows: "The code execution cannot proceed because zlib1.dll was not found.". This is due to a missing file with the generated Windows binary.
    
    * **Solution:** If you see this error, download `zlib1.dll` from [https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/releases/download/V20.0/zlib1.dll](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/releases/download/V20.0/zlib1.dll) and add it to your install folder. The node should run properly after that.
