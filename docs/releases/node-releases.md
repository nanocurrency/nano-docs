Updates to the Nano protocol are done through major node releases, occurring approximately every 1 to 4 months, and necessary patch releases in between. As changes are made to the protocol over time, newer node versions will stop peering with older versions. Details on which versions are actively peering, supported and being developed are included below.

## Current Release
The following release is the latest and only release actively supported by the Nano Foundation. This release and the [Active Releases](#active-releases) below represent the only node versions that will participate on the main network.
