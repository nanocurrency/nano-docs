	Release  | V19 Solidus
	---------|----------------------- 
	Goal     | Track height of confirmed blocks per account and confirm dependent elections based on this height.
	Benefits | Provide simpler block confirmation procedures, reduce network voting and confirmation traffic, and provide easier implementation of various future features.

??? tip "Dynamic Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Prioritization"

	Release  | V19 Solidus
	---------|----------------------- 
	Goal     | Capture work difficulty levels on the network and adjust wallet work generation dynamically when delays in confirmation for locally published blocks are experienced. Also include dropping of active transactions failing to confirm quickly.
	Benefits | Reduce impacts to regular users during spam attacks and increase cost of spam attacks.

??? tip "Out of node process RPC"

	Release  | V19 Solidus
	---------|----------------------- 
	Goal     | Remove RPC operations out of node process.
	Benefits | Reduced node attack surface as signing keys no longer in the same memory space as network and ledger code.

??? tip "Bandwidth throttling"

	Release  | V19 Solidus
	---------|----------------------- 
	Goal     | Provide configuration options for nodes to limit bandwidth resource usage.
	Benefits | More control over resource consumption for node operators and to provide a metric for analyzing more objectively the TPS capabilities of the network.

### Planned

??? abstract "Dual-phase voting"

	Release  | V20 (Targeted)
	---------|----------------------- 
	Goal     | Use a dual-phased voting approach: first is a negotiation phase to gather network consensus, and then second is issuing a final, durable vote that cannot be re-negotiated.
	Benefits | Blocks cemented after durable vote and allowing durable vote snapshots.
	Links    | 

??? abstract "Durable vote snapshots"

	Release  | V20 (Targeted)
	---------|----------------------- 
	Goal     | Provide methods for export and importing snapshots of durable votes between nodes.
	Benefits | Easier bootstrap verification through dependence on durable votes plus frontier elections only.
	Links    | 

??? abstract "Local account priority bootstrapping"

	Release  | V20 (Targeted)
	---------|----------------------- 
	Goal     | Allow bootstrapping of local accounts first.
	Benefits | Nodes can send/receive Nano before fully synced.
	Links    | [GitHub Issue #1731](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/issues/1731)

??? abstract "Move wallet out of process"

### Recent Changes

**2019-07-05**

* Confirmed-only bootstrapping removed from list - the complexity and effort level of this feature for the provided benefits didn't align to implement on it's own at this time. Situations that may warrant such a change, including long strings of forked blocks, will be monitored on the network and if seen, this feature will be reevaluated for inclusion in the future.

??? info "Other past changes"
	**2019-06-11**

	* Protobuf based RPCs target moved from V20 to V21
	* RPC 2.0 target moved from V20 to V21
