## Upgrade notices

All nodes are encouraged to upgrade to V27.0, including exchanges.

In general, exchanges, services and integrations are encouraged to join [the test network](../running-a-node/test-network.md) for performing integration testing. This network mimics the live network in work requirements but has a smaller number of nodes and a lower block count for easier setup.

### Database upgrade

V27 includes a one-way database upgrade that takes a few minutes to run.

### RPC changes

V27 RPC changes are  minor and non-breaking.

## Major updates

### Fair Queueing Enhancements
Designed by Piotr WÃ³jcik, the fair queue has been integrated into the nano node, ensuring equal processing time for each network peer. The fair queue orders requests in a fair, round-robin fashion which is needed by several components in the node, including block, network message, bootstrap request, and vote request processing. 

### Network Handling Rewrite
Significant portions of the networking stack have been rewritten and simplified. Legacy code that handled half-duplex TCP channels has been removed and all TCP connections now operate full-duplex. Asynchronous callback-style code has been replaced with coroutines in several places simplifying code flow.

### Network Flow Control Improvements
This suite of features optimises transaction processing, guards against spam and denial-of-service attacks, and ensures equitable resource distribution.

### Up to 255 votes per message
V27 allows voting messages to contain up to 255 votes per message, an increase from the previous limit of 12. This enhancement reduces network congestion and voting traffic, improving consensus efficiency and robustness. Note that this change de-peers nodes older than V26.0.

### Configurable Logging
A new, highly configurable logging system allows node operators to tailor logging levels and outputs, enhancing debugging and health monitoring without excessive disk space use.

### Bug fixes
Several bugs were fixed, including race conditions, missing notifications, & dependency issues.
