# Node Implementation - Voting

--8<-- "wip-living-whitepaper.md"

## Vote rebroadcasting

When a block is processed, Principal Representatives evaluate whether they can generate a vote for the block (dependent blocks already confirmed, etc.). If they can, they generate the vote and publish to all other PRs they are aware of in addition to `2*sqrt(peers)` of non-PR nodes.  To reduce the load on PRs nodes, they do not republish incoming votes - only Non-PR nodes republish other votes to `1/2*sqrt(peers)` to ensure enough coverage across the rest of the network.

Due to the direct 1:1 relationship between PR nodes, their latency is mostly geographic/network based. For Non-PRs, there is some gossiping via the random distribution, so the number of hops required is what makes up a majority of the latency and the geographic and network latency is less of a factor.
