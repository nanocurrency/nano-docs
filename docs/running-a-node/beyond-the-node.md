# Beyond the Node

## Building tools and services

Congrats! Now that you understand more about how Nano works and setup your own node to participate on the network, the next step is building tools and services on the node. Our [Integration Guides](/integration-guides/the-basics/) are a great starting point to help you understand how you can leverage your node to create amazing applications that utilize the unique value transfer features of Nano.

## Need some inspiration?

A big part of the Nano community is [the Nano Center](https://nanocenter.org/). Run by a group of Nano enthusiasts, their website helps manage requests for assistance and funding for Nano-related projects. Check out the in progress and past funded projects for some great ideas and opportunities to join in building on top of Nano!

For even more details about the many projects that help make our ecosystem robust, head over to [Nano.org](https://nano.org) for examples of wallets, services and more that have integrated Nano.
