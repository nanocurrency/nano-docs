title: Node Configuration
description: Dig into the most popular configuration options to help your Nano node work the best for your needs

# Node Configuration

The Nano node software is designed to run with little or no configuration. All configuration options have defaults that can be changed using TOML configuration files, by passing configuration values via the command line, or a combination of the two methods.

!!! success "Automatic migration and backups of JSON files"
    Versions prior to 20 use JSON as the configuration file format, and these will be automatically migrated to TOML files on startup. Note that only non-default values are migrated.

    In version 19.0 when the node is upgraded between releases, including any beta releases, all config files will be backed up prior to the upgrade in the same directory for easy recovery if needed.

    As TOML files are never upgraded by the node, no backups are created for these.

??? tip "V19.0 and earlier config.json file"

	Below is a complete example of the config.json file used by V19.0 and earlier:

	```json

## Configuration file locations

The node and its related processes will look for the files listed below, either in their default location or the location specified with `--data_path`. These files are *optional*. The table includes a command which can be used to generate a documented TOML file with defaults suitable for the system.

--8<-- "toml-config-commands.md"

The default locations of the config files are listed in the table below.

--8<-- "directory-locations.md"

## Options formatting

Config options are referred to in the documentation using the format `category.option` where `category` can be multiple levels. For example, the `node.enable_voting` option would correspond to the following entry in the TOML file:

```toml
[node]

# Enable or disable voting. Enabling this option requires additional system resources, namely increased CPU, bandwidth and disk usage.
# type:bool
enable_voting = true
```

While a multiple category option like `node.websocket.enable` would correspond to this TOML file entry:

```toml
[node.websocket]

# Enable or disable WebSocket server.
# type:bool
enable = false
```

## Passing config values on the command line

Instead of changing the config file, config values can be passed in via the `--config` option, which can be repeated multiple times.

Example that enables the RPC and WebSocket servers:

`nano_node --config rpc.enable=true --config node.websocket.enable=true`

Strings are passed with escaped quotes (`\"`), such as:

`nano_node --config node.httpcallback.target=\"api/callback\"`

!!! info "Mixing config options on the command line and TOML files"
    If a config file exists, config values passed in via the command line will take precedence.

## Notable configuration options

As of _V20.0_ the sample TOML packaged with the binaries and available for [generation via the command line](#configuration-file-locations) are commented out with descriptions of each option. Where applicable the following integration areas have those options included along with additional context where necessary.

### Work generation
See the [Work Generation guide](../integration-guides/work-generation.md#node-configuration).

### WebSockets
See the [WebSockets Integration guide](../integration-guides/websockets.md#configuration).

### RPC

--8<-- "config-node-option-rpc-enable-true.md"

#### enable_control
This configuration option is set in the [`config-rpc.toml`](../running-a-node/configuration.md#configuration-file-locations) file.

Due to their sensitive or dangerous nature, certain RPC calls/options require this setting to be enabled before they can be used. Examples of RPC calls that require this include:

* [stop](../commands/rpc-protocol.md#stop): allows you to completely stop the node from running
* [work_generate](../commands/rpc-protocol.md#work_generate): allows potential consumption of CPU or GPU resources on the node or attached work peers to generate PoW
* [send](../commands/rpc-protocol.md#send): can be used to transfer available funds in the wallet to another account
* Various other wallet and resource-heavy operations

```toml
# Enable or disable control-level requests.
# WARNING: Enabling this gives anyone with RPC access the ability to stop the node and access wallet funds.
# type:bool
enable_control = false
```

!!! danger "Dangerous RPC calls controlled by `enable_control`"
	Due to the sensitive or dangerous nature of these calls, **caution should be used when considering setting `enable_control` to `true`** in your config file. It is highly recommended to **only enable this when RPC ports are listening exclusively to local or loopback IP addresses** or other measure are put in place outside the node to limit RPC access to dangerous calls. For more details see the [Node Security page](security.md).

More advanced options for controlling the process the RPC server runs under can be found in the [Running Nano as a service guide](../integration-guides/advanced.md#running-nano-as-a-service).

#### logging.stable_log_filename

--8<-- "known-issue-windows-logging-stable.md"

This configuration option is set in the [`config-node.toml` file](../running-a-node/configuration.md#configuration-file-locations).

By default this option is set to `false` which results in all log files having a timestamp appended to them, even the currently active file. If set to `true` the currently active log file will have a static name at `log/node.log` for easier management.

```toml
[logging]

# Append to log/node.log without a timestamp in the filename.
# The file is not emptied on startup if it exists, but appended to.
# type:bool
stable_log_filename = true
```

#### logging.log_rpc
This configuration option is set in the [`config-rpc.toml`](../running-a-node/configuration.md#configuration-file-locations) file.

By default, all RPC calls and the time spent handling each one are [logged](../running-a-node/troubleshooting.md#log-files). This can be optionally turned off by switching option `logging.log_rpc` to `false`

```toml
[logging]

# Whether to log RPC calls.
# type:bool
log_rpc = true
```

### IPC
See the [IPC Integration guide](../integration-guides/ipc-integration.md#configuration).

### Voting
See the [Voting as a Representative guide](voting-as-a-representative.md).

### Ledger backends
See the [Ledger Management guide](ledger-management.md).

### HTTPS support
See the [HTTPS Support guide](configuration-https.md).

### HTTP callback

!!! tip
	When possible, using a [WebSocket](../integration-guides/websockets.md#configuration) is recommended as it provides more efficiency, more options for types of information to receive and better control over the volume of notifications with filtering.

These configuration options are set in the [`config-node.toml`](../running-a-node/configuration.md#configuration-file-locations) file.

```toml
[node.httpcallback]

# Callback address.
# type:string,ip
#address = ""

# Callback port number.
# type:uint16
#port = 0

# Callback target path.
# type:string,uri
#target = ""
```

JSON POST requests with every confirmed block are sent to the callback server as defined in the config values above: `http://callback_address:callback_port<callback_target>`. Callback target should include a leading slash.

For details on how to integrate using the HTTP callback, see the [HTTP Callback section of the Integration Guides](../integration-guides/advanced.md#http-callback).
