## Configuration File Locations

The node uses the `config.json` and `rpc_config.json` files found in the following locations:

--8<-- "folder-locations.md"

!!! success "Backups of config files on upgrade"
    In versions 19.0+ when the node is upgraded between releases, including any beta releases, all config files will be backed up prior to the upgrade in the same folder for easy recovery if needed.

---

## config.json

This is the main configuration file for controlling node behavior. Below is an example file with most option and further details on specific configuration items.

### Configuration options

#### enable_voting
As of V18.0, newly setup nodes will have voting disabled by default. In order to participate in network consensus, this value must be updated to enable voting and the node restarted.

```json
"enable_voting": "true"
```

---

#### vote_minimum
As of V18.0, nodes with weight delegated to them under this value in their config will not vote, regardless of the `enable_voting` flag setting. In order for a node to vote, this value must be lower than the weight delegated to the representative account setup on the node.

```json
"vote_minimum": "1000000000000000000000000000000000"
```

---

#### work_peers
Used when offloading work generation to another node or service. Format must be ipv6, preceded by `::ffff:` if ipv4. Hostnames are not allowed at this time. Calls are made to the ip:port designated using the standard RPC format [work_generate](/commands/rpc-protocol#work_generate). 
```json
"work_peers": [
    "::ffff:127.0.0.1:7076"
],
```

---

#### opencl_enable

To enable GPU acceleration for PoW, set `"opencl_enable"` to `"true"`. Other OpenCL parameters may need to be adjusted depending on the desired setup (see [example config.json file](#configjson) above).

---

#### ipc

On startup, the node will generate configuration options for IPC, one entry for each transport. By default, IPC is disabled.

```json
"ipc": {
   "tcp": {
       "enable": "false",
       "port": "7077",
       "io_timeout": "15000"
   },
   "local": {
       "enable": "false",
       "path": "\/tmp\/nano",
       "io_timeout": "15000"
     }
},
```

Each transport also supports an experimental "io_threads" configuration value. If not present (default), the node's IO event loop will be used. If a value is present, a separate event loop with N threads will be created for the transport. For certain transports, this may scale better on some systems.

Because the only IPC encoding is currently "legacy RPC", the RPC config options like "enable_control" still applies.

For details about using the IPC setup, see the [IPC Integration Guide](/integration-guides/advanced#ipc-integration).

---

#### websocket

!!! note ""
    Available in Version 19.0+ only

```json
"node": {
    "websocket": {
        "enable": "true",
        "address": "::1",
        "port": "7078"
    },
}
```

With the above configuration, localhost clients should connect to `ws://[::1]:7078`. For details on how to integrate using websockets, see the [Websocket Support section of the Integration Guides](/integration-guides/advanced#websocket-support).

---

#### HTTP callback

```json
"node": {
	"callback_address": "::ffff:127.0.0.1",
	"callback_port": "17076",
	"callback_target": "/"
}
```

JSON POST requests with every confirmed block are sent to the callback server as defined in the config values above: `http://callback_address:callback_port<callback_target>`. Callback target should include a leading slash.

For details on how to integrate using the HTTP callback, see the [HTTP Callback section of the Integration Guides](/integration-guides/advanced#http-callback).

!!! tip
	When possible, using the [websockets](#websocket) is recommended as it provides more efficiency, more options for types of information to receive and better control over the volume of notifications with filtering.

---

## rpc_config.json

This is the configuration that controls how the RPC server connects and behaves when communicating with the node.

!!! note ""
    Available in Version 19.0+ only

### Example file

```json
{
    "address": "::ffff:127.0.0.1", // Allowed IP for RPC connection
    "port": "7076", // Default RPC port
    "enable_control": "true", // Enable particular RPC command like: send, account_create, etc...
    "max_json_depth": "20", // prevent JSON overflow. Default recommended
    "version": "1",
    "max_request_size": "33554432",
    "process": {
        "io_threads": "8", // Number of threads listening to RPC requests 
        "ipc_port": "46000", // Must match port in ipc -> tcp of node config file
        "num_ipc_connections": "8" // Max number of connections with nano_node (io_threads in config.json should be at least this number)
    }
}
```

More details about the RPC setup can be found in the [Running Nano as a service guide](/integration-guides/advanced/#running-nano-as-a-service).
