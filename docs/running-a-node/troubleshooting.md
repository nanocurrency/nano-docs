# Troubleshooting

## Log Files

The default location of standard node log files for various systems:

| **OS**  | **Location** |
|---------|--------------|
| Windows | `:::bash C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Nano\log` -or- `:::bash %LOCALAPPDATA%\Nano\log`  |
| OSX     | `:::bash /Users/<user>/Library/Nano/log ` |
| Linux   | `:::bash /home/<user>/Nano/log ` |

## What to do if the node crashes (Linux)

!!! warning "Do not restart the node"
    If your node crashes, please follow this guide before attempting to run it again.

If the node crashes, the most commonly seen message is "Segmentation fault (core dumped)". When using docker, this message will only show up in the docker logs. In any case, this is often not enough to go on in terms of figuring out what went wrong. The next steps detail what you should do to provide us with as much information as possible about the problem.

When you are done gathering all information, please [create a new Github issue](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/issues/new), or [reach us on Discord](https://chat.nano.org) in the *#support* channel, detailing your issue as much as possible.

!!! example "Step 1: Getting version information"
    This command prints the node build information.

    **Not using docker:**
    ```bash
    ./nano_node --version
    ```
    **Using docker:**
    ```bash
    docker exec ${NANO_NAME} nano_node --version
    ```

    Example output:
    ```
    Version 20.0
    Build Info d5abc6ab "GNU C++ version " "7.4.0" "BOOST 107000" BUILT "Aug  6 2019"
    ```

!!! example "Step 2: Getting dmesg information"
    Depending on the error, it is possible you do not find any useful information in this step, in which case please move on to Step 3.
    Run the following command and look for `nano_node` at the end. If you see a relevant message, gather all messages with a similar timestamp - the number within brackets on the left.

    ```bash
    dmesg
    ```

    Example output:
    ```
    [    6.336071] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): wlp2s0: link becomes ready
    [    6.375123] wlp2s0: Limiting TX power to 23 (23 - 0) dBm as advertised by **:**:**:**:**:**
    [ 6141.711993] show_signal_msg: 23 callbacks suppressed
    [ 6141.711995] I/O[14487]: segfault at 1 ip 000055c69d3a1634 sp 00007f6e9332df10 error 6 in nano_node[55c69d25f000+70b000]
    [ 6141.711999] Code: 24 70 48 83 c5 10 48 89 c3 48 39 ef 74 b6 e8 e3 b8 39 00 eb af 90 41 57 41 56 41 55 41 54 49 89 fc 55 53 48 81 ec a8 00 00 00 <c6> 04 25 01 00 00 00 31 64 48 8b 04 25 28 00 00 00 48 89 84 24 98
    ```

    From this output, only the last 3 lines are relevant.

!!! example "Step 3: Getting syslog information"
    More information might be available in syslog. Run the following command and look for the time the crash ocurred.

    ```bash
    cat /var/log/syslog
    ```

    Example output:
    ```
    Aug 15 11:56:07 ubuntu-server kernel: [6141.711993] show_signal_msg: 23 callbacks suppressed
    Aug 15 11:56:07 ubuntu-server kernel: [6141.711995] I/O[25975]: segfault at 1 ip 000055b2960e2d24 sp 00007fcff50f6fc0 error 6 in nano_node[55b295f9b000+6d8000]
    Aug 15 11:56:07 ubuntu-server kernel: [6141.711999] Code: 24 70 48 83 c5 10 48 89 c3 48 39 ef 74 b6 e8 e3 b8 39 00 eb af 90 41 57 41 56 41 55 41 54 49 89 fc 55 53 48 81 ec a8 00 00 00 <c6> 04 25 01 00 00 00 31 64 48 8b 04 25 28 00 00 00 48 89 84 24 98
    ```

    Include the relevant lines from the output. In this example, the log is similar to the one from Step 2.

!!! example "Step 4: Getting the latest node log"
    The following command will order the log files such that the first one in the output is the most recent. If you restarted the node since the crash, then the relevant log file is not the latest one. Please be careful to give us the relevant log file.

    ```bash
    # Nano -> NanoBeta if debugging a beta node
    ls -dlt ~/Nano/log/* | head
    ```

    Please provide the complete log file.

!!! example "Step 5: Getting a backtrace dump"
    This command will produce some basic information about the error.

    **Not using docker**:
    ```bash
    ./nano_node --debug_output_last_backtrace_dump > nano_node_backtrace_output.txt
    ```

    **Using docker**:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /tmp/nano_node_crash && cd $_
    docker exec ${NANO_NAME} nano_node --debug_output_last_backtrace_dump > nano_node_backtrace_output.txt
    docker exec ${NANO_NAME} sh -c 'mkdir -p crash_files; mv nano_node_crash*.txt crash_files/'
    docker cp ${NANO_NAME}:/crash_files/ . && mv crash_files/* .
    ```

!!! example "Step 6: Producing the archive file"
    See the output of this command for the name of the file you should include in your report.
    ```bash
    FILE="nano_node_crash_$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S.tar.gz")" && tar czf $FILE --exclude=*.tar.gz nano_node_* && echo "Created archive $FILE"
    ```

## Statistics from RPC

The "stats" RPC command can be used by external processes to query statistics, such as traffic counters. This is useful for diagnostics, monitoring and display in admin consoles. 

Statistics are optionally logged to separate text files.

For implementations details, please see [Statistics API](https://github.com/cryptocode/raiblocks/wiki/Statistics-API)

!!! warning "Duplicate observer stats"
    Under certain conditions, confirmations seen through the observer type stat can be duplicates. In order to get accurate data, block hashes must be tracked and validated against previously seen hashes.

### Configuration

All configuration nodes and values are optional, with the default values shown in comments below:

```json

    ...
    "statistics": {

        // Sampling configuration (optional)

            "interval": "1000"                // Sample interval in milliseconds. Must be set if sampling is enabled.
        },

        // File logging (optional)
        "log": {                              
            "interval_counters": "5000",      // How often to write counters to file in milliseconds. Default 0 (off)

            "rotation_count": "5",            // Rotate file after writing statistics this many times. Default 100.
            "headers": "true",                // Write header containing log

## Troubleshooting UPnP

### Ensure UPnP is enabled
UPnP will be enabled unless the external port is set in either the config
```toml
[node]
...
# The external address of this node (NAT). If not set, the node will request this information via UPnP.
# type:string,ip
external_address = "::ffff:<some_public_ipv4>"
```
or via cli flag
```bash
--config node.external_address="::ffff:<some_public_ipv4>"
```

### Enable UPnP logging
Appending this to your launch command will enable upnp logging.
```bash
--config node.logging.upnp_details=true
```
### Error UPnP Messages
Check the beginning of the logs for UPNP_* messages

!!! error "Port Mapping Conflict"
    Check for static routes
    ```bash
    [2019-Oct-29 11:06:56.641389]: UPnP failed 718: ConflictInMappingEntry
    [2019-Oct-29 11:06:56.644387]: UPnP failed 718: ConflictInMappingEntry
    ```

### Normal UPnP Messages

!!! note ""
    ```bash
    [2019-Oct-29 11:06:56.641389]: UPNP_GetSpecificPortMappingEntry failed 714: NoSuchEntryInArray
    [2019-Oct-29 11:06:56.644387]: UPNP_GetSpecificPortMappingEntry failed 714: NoSuchEntryInArray
    ```
    This message is expected when starting the node and will go away after the UPnP has mappeded the port
