# Joining the beta network

A few common reasons for joining the beta network include:

* Learning node setup and management
* Testing out integrations for services build on Nano before running on the main network
* [Assisting testing new node releases and features](#node-release-testing)
* Contributing to a network testing various behaviors and patterns with the protocol

[Running a beta node](#running-a-beta-node) is a great way to join in and help the network grow stronger.

## Node release testing
The beta network is also used to coordinate the testing of Nano node releases. The Nano Foundation maintains a few beta nodes on the network and various community members also setup nodes to help provide an environment more similar to the main network. Ahead of each release builds are published as Release Candidates (RC). Starting with RC1 and incrementing with each published build (RC2, RC3, etc.), these are intended for use on the beta network to help identify issues not discovered earlier in the development process.

We invite anyone interested in contributing to Nano to consider participating on the beta network. Not only is it beneficial to the ecosystem, it is also a great way to learn more about setting up and managing a node.

!!! warning
	* Release candidate builds are only recommended for use on the beta network
	* The fastest and most recommended method of installation is through [Docker](#running-a-beta-node)
	* Binaries and other details can be found at: https://beta.nano.org/

## Running a beta node

Setting up a node on the beta network is similar to the main network. To start you should [install docker](/running-a-node/node-setup/#installing-docker) and be familiar with the general setup and [Docker management](/running-a-node/docker-management/) processes.

### Pulling the Docker image
[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/nanocurrency/nano.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/nanocurrency/nano-beta)

Pulls the latest release of the Nano Node:
```bash
docker pull nanocurrency/nano-beta
```

Pulls a specific version of the Nano node:
```bash
docker pull nanocurrency/nano-beta:V19.0RC1
```

Pulls the latest release which includes any release candidate versions:
```bash
docker pull nanocurrency/nano-beta:latest-including-rc
```

A list of beta tags can be found at the official [Nano Currency Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nanocurrency/nano-beta/tags)

### Starting the Docker container

```bash
docker run --restart=unless-stopped -d \
  -p 54000:54000/udp \
  -p 54000:54000 \
  -p [::1]:55000:55000 \
  -v ${NANO_HOST_FOLDER_BETA}:/root \
  --name ${NANO_NAME} \
  nanocurrency/nano-beta:latest-including-rc
```

!!! tip
	* For an explanation of the options included in the Docker `run` command, see [Starting the Container](/running-a-node/docker-management/#starting) details for the main network.
	* See [Docker management](/running-a-node/docker-management/) for other related commands

!!! warning "Separate host folders"
	Be sure to use a different host folder for main network and beta network Docker node setups. Attempting to use the same folder will result in issues.
