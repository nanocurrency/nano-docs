If this hit something like the binance chain or (any long chain) it could use a lot of memory (unbounded amount). So this brought about the bounded confirmation height processor algorithm which starts at the very bottom of the account chains but does the same recursion when a receive block is hit. This limits the amount of block hashes needing to be stored in memory to be able to cement the bottom most blocks. Checkpoints are used if there are a lot of accounts which need to be traversed to reach which exceeds the maximum amount of memory .

This does use a lot more memory though which is why this is limited to a certain number of blocks, once the unbounded cutoff is exceeded the bounded processor resumes.  </p> <p>Both algorithms operate with a read transaction first which reduces write lock held time as it can do a lot of iterating.

A solution is available for the no gui nano_node (see https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/issues/79), but no concrete solution is available for the GUI client. However, a workaround can be acheived via the use of symbolic links. Below is a short tutorial for Windows builds:</p> <ol> <li>Rename/delete the Nano directory in your <code>appdata</code> Local directory (if you haven't run the wallet yet, skip this step). This is necessary because the command to create a symbolic link in windows will fail if the the input directory already exists.</li> <li>Decide on where you want to store the blockchain and create a symbolic link. The command is (in an administrative command-prompt): <code>mklink /d \"C:\\Users\\&lt;user&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\Nano\\\" \"E:\\Some\\Other\\Directory\"</code>. This command creates a symbolic link for a directory (<code>/d</code>) that 'redirects' all requests for files/directories in the <code>Local\\Nano</code> directory to the <code>Other\\Directory</code>. This means that a file created in the input directory will actually be in the output directory (on the other disk).</li> <li>Verify it works. Create a file in your Nano directory in your appdata, and you should see it appear in the directory you linked it to (and vice-versa). If you have old wallets or a partially-downloaded blockchain, copy them back into the local directory. Start the wallet.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"integration-guides/build-options/#requirements-setup","title":"Requirements &amp; setup","text":"<p>Unsupported configuration</p> <ul> <li>This documentation is intended only for developers of the Nano Node software, and will not result in a supported configuration.

Would this result in me sending excess funds to the recipient?</p> <p>If you followed this guide, then the answer is \"no\". When you issued the <code>account_info</code> RPC command, you received the account's balance at a specific blockhash on its account-chain. In your crafted transaction, you specify that hash in the <code>\"previous\"</code> field. If funds were signed into your account, the headblock on your account-chain would change. Since your send no longer refers to the headblock on your account-chain when broadcasted, the network would reject your transaction.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Since only the resulting balance is recorded, the transaction amount is interpreted as the difference in balance from the previous block on the account-chain and the newly created block. For this reason, it is crucial that you obtain the current account balance and headblock in the same atomic <code>account_info</code> RPC command.</p> <p>When not following this guide closely, the following inappropriate sequence of events could lead to erroneous amounts sent to a recipient.</p> <ol> <li>An account's balance, say 5 nano, was obtained using the <code>account_balance</code>. This balance is valid as of hypothetical BLOCK_A.</li> <li>By another process you control, a receive (BLOCK_B) was signed and broadcasted into your account-chain (race-condition).</li> <li>Lets say this <code>receive</code> increased the funds on the account chain by 10 nano, resulting in a final balance 15 nano.</li> <li>The account's frontier block is obtained by the <code>accounts_frontiers</code> RPC command, returning the hash of BLOCK_B. Other transaction metadata is obtained by other RPC commands.</li> <li>With the collected data, if a send transaction was created for 3 nano, the final balance would be computed as 5 - 3, or 2 nano.</li> <li>When this is broadcasted, since it is referring to the current head block on the account, BLOCK_B, the network would accept it. But, because the balance as of BLOCK_B was actually 15 nano, this would result in 12 nano being sent to the recipient.</li> </ol> <p>For this reason, only populate transaction data source from a single <code>account_info</code> RPC call.</p> <p>Step 3: Broadcast the transaction</p> <p>As a result of the command above, the nano_node will return a signed, but not yet broadcasted transaction.

Defense Blocks publishing is rate-limited by work so this limits accounts to a certain extent.  Nodes that are not full historical nodes can prune accounts below a statistical metric where the account is probably not a valid account.  Finally, Nano is tuned to use minimal permanent storage space so space required to store one additional account is proportional to the size of one block + indexing ~ 96b + 32b ~ 128b.  This equates to 1GB being able to store 8 million penny-spend account.  If nodes want to be aggressive, they can calculate a distribution based on access frequency and delegate infrequently used accounts to slower storage."},{"location":"protocol-design/attack-vectors/#50-attack","title":"&gt;50% attack","text":"Risk Low Impacts Completely destructive Description The metric of consensus for Nano is a balance weighted voting system.  If an attacker is able to gain over 50% of the voting strength, they can cause the network to oscillate their decisions rendering the system useless.  An attacker must have at least some value tied up in the network as a balance which they're willing to forfeit as an expense to performing this type of attack since this attack ruins the integrity of the system.  An attacker is able to lower the amount of balance they must forfeit by preventing good nodes from voting through a network DDOS. Defense There are multiple levels of defense against this type of attack:<ul><li>Primary defense: voting weight being tied to investment in the system; attempting to flip the ledger would be destructive to the system as a whole which would destroy their investment.</li><li>Secondary defense: cost of this attack is proportional to the market cap of all of Nano.  In proof of work systems, technology can be invented that gives disproportionate control compared to monetary investment and if the attack is successful, this technology could be repurposed after the attack is complete.  With Nano the cost of attacking the system scales with the system and if an attack were to be successful the cost of the attack can't be recovered.</li><li>Tertiary defense: In order to maintain the maximum quorum of voters, the next line of defense is representative voting.  Account holders who are unable to reliably participate in voting for connectivity reasons can name a representative who can vote with the weight of their balance.</li><li>Forks in Nano are never accidental so nodes can make policy decisions on how to interact with forked blocks.  The only time non-attacker accounts are vulnerable to block forks is if they receive a balance from an attacking account.  Accounts wanting to be secure from block forks can wait a little or a lot longer before receiving from an account who generated forks or opt to never receive at all.  Receivers could also generate separate accounts for receiving from dubious accounts in order to protect the rest of their balance.</li><li>A final line of defense is block cementing.  As blocks are confirmed in V19.0+, the node marks the height of the last block confirmed for every account and will refuse the replacement of an already confirmed block. Attempts to fork after previous confirmation of a block will immediately fail.</li>The most sophisticated version of a &gt;50% attack is detailed in the diagram below.  \"Offline\" is the percentage of representatives who have been named but are not online to vote.  \"Stake\" is the amount of investment the attacker is voting with and will be lost if they successfully attack the system.  \"Active\" are representatives that are online and voting according to the protocol.  An attacker can offset the amount of stake they must forfeit by knocking other voters offline via a network denial of service attack.  If this attack can be sustained, the representatives being attacked will become unsynchronized and this is demonstrated by \"Unsynced\".  Finally, an attacker can gain a short burst in relative voting strength by switching their denial of service attack to a new set of representatives while the old set is resynchronizing their ledger, this is demonstrated by \"Attacked\".If an attacker is able to cause Stake &gt; Active by a combination of these circumstances, they would be able to successfully flip votes on the ledger at the expense of their stake.  We can estimate how much this type of attack could cost by examining the market cap of other systems.  If we estimate 33% of representatives are offline or attacked via denial of service, an attacker would need to purchase 33% of the market cap in order to attack the system via voting.Voting attack cost:<ul><li>Euro - M1 in 2014 ~6 trillion, attack amount 2 trillion</li><li>USD - M0 in 2014 ~4 trillion, attack amount 1.2 trillion</li><li>UK pound sterling - M0 in 2007 ~1.5 trillion, attack amount 500 billion</li><li>Bitcoin - Market cap 2014 ~3 billion, attack amount 1 billion</li>"},{"location":"protocol-design/attack-vectors/#bootstrap-poisoning","title":"Bootstrap poisoning","text":"Risk Low Impacts New-user denial of service Description The longer an attacker is able to hold an old private key with a balance, the higher the probability of balances that existed at that time no longer having representatives that are participating in voting because their balances or representatives have transferred to new people.  This means if a node is bootstrapped to an old representation of the network where the attacker has a quorum of voting stake compare to representatives at that point in time, they would be able to oscillate voting decisions to that node.  If this new user wanted to interact with anyone besides the attacking node all of their transactions would be denied since they have different head blocks.  The net result is nodes can waste the time of new nodes in the network by feeding them bad information. Defense Nodes can be paired with an initial database of accounts and known-good block heads; this is a replacement for downloading the database all the way back to the genesis block.  The closer the download is to be current, the higher the probability of accurately defending against this attack.  In the end this attack is probably no worse than feeding junk data to nodes while bootstrapping since they wouldn't be able to transact with anyone who has a contemporary database."},{"location":"protocol-design/attack-vectors/#other-attacks","title":"Other attacks","text":"<ul> <li>Network Attacks Part 2 - Additional deep-dive into potential attack vectors &amp; mitigations</li> </ul> <p>Existing whitepaper sections related to this page:</p> <ul> <li>Attack Vectors</li> </ul>"},{"location":"protocol-design/blocks/","title":"Protocol Design - Blocks","text":"Part of work in progress Living Whitepaper <p>This page is part of the Living Whitepaper revisions currently underway to replace the original static whitepaper.

In order to function effectively, a currency must be easily transferable, non-reversible, and have limited or no fees. Unfortunately, increased transaction times, high fees, limited network scalability, and high energy consumption have raised questions about the practicality of Bitcoin as an everyday currency.  Here we introduce Nano, a cryptocurrency with a novel block-lattice architecture where each account has its own blockchain, enabling near instant confirmation, feeless transactions, and scalability that is not artificially limited by protocol-side variables like block sizes or block times. </p>"},{"location":"protocol-design/introduction/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Nano is a low-latency, feeless, scalable, and environmentally friendly cryptocurrency that improves on many of Bitcoin's core properties via unique design decisions. For example, each Nano user has their own blockchain, allowing them to update their chain asynchronously vs other transactions on the network, resulting in fast transactions with minimal overhead. Transactions keep track of account balances rather than transaction amounts, allowing aggressive database pruning without compromising security. Consensus is maintained by Open Representative Voting (ORV), which facilitates irreversible finality (full-settlement). User-selected representative nodes vote on each transaction, and every node independently cements each transaction after seeing enough representative votes to achieve quorum.</p> <p>To date, the Nano network has processed more than 118 million transactions with an unpruned ledger size of only 68GB. Average transaction confirmation time during typical network conditions is 0.2 seconds <sup>2</sup>. The production network has seen traffic as high as 161 CPS (80.5-161 TPS), while the beta network has achieved &gt;1800 CPS (900-1800 TPS) <sup>3</sup>.

A key innovation brought about by Bitcoin was the blockchain, a public, immutable and decentralized data-structure which is used as a ledger for the currency\u2019s transactions. Unfortunately, as Bitcoin matured, several issues in the protocol made Bitcoin prohibitive for many applications: </p> <ol> <li> <p>Poor scalability: Each block in the blockchain can store a limited amount of data, which means the system can only process so many transactions per second, making spots in a block a commodity. Median transaction fees fluctuate between a few cents and as high as $34 (currently ~$2.98 as of August 26, 2020) <sup>9</sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p>High latency: Average confirmation times fluctuate between 10 and 300 minutes <sup>10</sup>. In addition, most Bitcoin services require more than one confirmation before considering a transaction fully-settled <sup>11</sup>, which adds additional latency for end users.</p> </li> <li> <p>Power inefficient: The Bitcoin network consumes an estimated 67.26TWh per year (comparable to the power consumption of the Czech Republic), using an average of 570kWh per transaction <sup>12</sup>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, function by achieving consensus on their global ledgers in order to verify legitimate transactions while resisting malicious actors. Bitcoin achieves consensus via an economic measure called Proof of Work (PoW). In a PoW system participants compete to compute a number, called a nonce, such that the hash of the entire block is in a target range. This valid range is inversely proportional to the cumulative computation power of the entire Bitcoin network in order to maintain a consistent average time taken to find a valid nonce. The finder of a valid nonce is then allowed to add the block to the blockchain; therefore, those who exhaust more computational resources to compute a nonce play a greater role in the state of the blockchain. PoW provides resistance against a Sybil attack, where an entity behaves as multiple entities to gain additional power in a decentralized system, and also greatly reduces race conditions that inherently exist while accessing a global data-structure. </p> <p>An alternative consensus protocol, Proof of Stake (PoS), was first introduced by Peercoin in 2012 <sup>4</sup>. In a PoS system, participants vote with a weight equivalent to the amount of wealth they possess in a given cryptocurrency. With this arrangement, those who have a greater financial investment are given more power and are inherently incentivized to maintain the honesty of the system or risk losing their investment. PoS does away with the wasteful computation power competition, only requiring light-weight software running on low power hardware. </p> <p>While Nano uses a weighted-voting system that can be compared to PoS, it differs significantly from traditional PoS. See the Open Representative Voting (ORV) page for more details.</p> <p>The original Nano (RaiBlocks) paper and first beta implementation were published in December, 2014, making it one of the first Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based cryptocurrencies <sup>5</sup>. Soon after, other DAG cryptocurrencies began to develop, most notably DagCoin, Obyte (formerly Byteball) and IOTA <sup>6</sup>, <sup>7</sup>, <sup>8</sup>. These DAG-based cryptocurrencies broke the blockchain mold, improving system performance and security. Obyte achieves consensus by relying on a \u201cmain-chain\u201d comprised of honest, reputable and user-trusted \u201cwitnesses\u201d, while IOTA achieves consensus via the cumulative PoW of stacked transactions. Nano achieves consensus via a balance-weighted vote on conflicting transactions. This consensus system provides quicker, more deterministic transactions while still maintaining a strong, decentralized system. Nano continues this development and has positioned itself as one of the highest performing cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>Existing whitepaper sections related to this page:</p> <ul> <li>Introduction</li> <li>Background</li> </ul> <p>Other existing content related to this page:</p> <ul> <li>Nano Overview</li> <li>Representatives and Voting</li> <li>Incentives to run a node</li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>S.

This converts a seemingly shared data structure (a global blockchain) into a set of non-shared ones (individual account-chains).</p> <p>Each Nano node determines for itself whether or not to add a valid transaction to its local ledger. This means that there is no waiting for leader-selection as there is in single-blockchain cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where a single miner or staker extends the global blockchain with a new block (group of transactions) after solving a Proof-of-Work or being chosen through random selection. The block lattice ledger design removes this bottleneck, drastically decreasing transaction latency, improving decentralization, and simplifying transaction validation. Nano has no concept of block sizes or block times that arbitrarily limit the number of transactions that can be processed - the network will confirm as many transactions as current network conditions allow.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1.

In order to make spam more costly, each valid block in Nano requires a proof-of-work (PoW) solution to be attached to it - similar to the original Hashcash proposition<sup>1</sup>. Participants can compute the required work in a few seconds, and verification time for this work is negligible (to prevent invalid blocks, large work, and/or invalid work from becoming a denial-of-service attack vector). The cost of spamming the network then increases linearly with the number of spam transactions, reducing the impact of spam from theoretically infinite to a manageable amount.</p> <p>In addition to proof-of-work, another key component of Nano's defense against spam is transaction prioritization using a round-robin balance-bucket system, combined with least-recently-used (LRU) prioritization within those buckets. This system ensures that spam does not prevent legitimate users from making transactions &amp; achieving fast confirmation, which in turn removes some of the incentives to spam (e.g. network disruption). See the prioritization details &amp; prioritization buckets sections below for more information. While prioritization can be considered a \"Node Implementation\" topic, it's included in this \"Protocol Design\" discussion due to its relevance to spam resistance.</p>"},{"location":"protocol-design/spam-work-and-prioritization/#spam-resistance-features","title":"Spam resistance features","text":"<p>Below is a list of some of Nano's key spam mitigation features.</p> Feature Description Version bandwidth_limit Restricts outbound bandwidth to a user-configurable limit. 10 MB/s by default. V19+ Balance tiers (buckets) As of V27, there are 63 balance tiers (buckets) that nodes rotate through in a round-robin manner. Spamming a single bucket (e.g. \u04fe0.0001) has minimal impact on accounts in other buckets (e.g. \u04fe1, \u04fe5, etc). See prioritization details below. V22+ Bootstrap limits Configurable ascended bootstrapper limits via requests_limit, database_requests_limit, pull_count, timeout, bootstrap_bandwidth_limit, bootstrap_connections_max, etc. Default outbound bootstrap traffic limit is 5MB/s. Default max incoming bootstrap connections count is 64 (lower values save IOPs &amp; bandwidth). V25+ Bounded active election buckets Limits election bucket size and allows for dynamically dropping and scheduling higher priority elections. Buckets can be configured to opportunistically use more available space if AEC is underutilized. V27+ Bounded block backlog Implements limits on unconfirmed transaction storage and processing, which helps ensure consistent confirmation rates during high network load and prevents resource exhaustion attacks. V28+ Bounded unchecked memory table Add a memory container for unchecked blocks once the initial bootstrap threshold is reached, with blocks pruned in FIFO order. Limited to two items per dependency. V23.3+ Fair queueing Each peer (node) &amp; each component (e.g. block processor, vote processor, bootstrap server, request aggregator, etc) gets its own small queue with a configurable size &amp; priority. Nodes process these queues in a (weighted) round robin manner. This ensures that even when network is under stress, data coming from well-behaved peers is ingested quickly. V27+ Final vote replies For blocks that are marked as final or confirmed, nodes will only respond with final votes (not non-final votes). This signficantly reduces network (specifically voting) traffic. V27+ Hinted elections A percentage of election slots are reserved for hinted elections, meaning that nodes start elections for transactions with a high vote weight, regardless of individual node priority. This allows the network to progress forward on confirmations, keeping the network in sync. V24+ Hinted elections for dependencies The hinted election scheduler now detects cases when the node falls behind the network and is missing confirmations for block dependencies, and then activates elections for the blocks that were missed. V26+ is_originator flag Adds a flag to publish messages that identifies if a block is from a node that performed the initial flooding. Helps ensure original blocks get priority over republished blocks. V27+ Lazy bootstrapping Similar to optimistic elections, but for bootstrapping. Passively listens for votes on the real-time network, and confirms block dependencies if the (more recent) block is confirmed. V17+ Least-Recently Used (LRU) Prioritization Within a given balance tier (bucket), the least-recently-used account has the highest priority. V22+ Local block broadcaster Only rebroadcast blocks during active elections. Move initial block gossip responsibility to the block originator. V27+ message_deserializer checks Check for correct message formats before full processing (valid work, valid header, valid message type, valid version, valid network bytes (magic bytes), etc). All Optimistic elections If a more recent block is confirmed, all of its dependencies are also confirmed. V25+ Prevent requeuing of blocks with invalid signatures Requeueing of blocks with invalid signatures during lazy bootstrapping is not needed, since an invalid signature will always be invalid and doesn't need to be bootstrapped again. V25+ Proof-of-Work Each Nano transaction requires a small Proof-of-Work. All Rep crawler overhaul Consistently find representatives, even when vote requests are unreliable V27+ Traffic Shaping Enables more equal distribution of network resources among peers &amp; proactively manages network traffic to help prevent congestion. V28+ Vote by hash Instead of voting with a full block (256 bytes), representatives vote with block hashes (32 bytes), and batch these hashes. As of V27, nodes can vote for up to 255 hashes in a single vote. V15+ Vote Distribution Optimization Separate vote flooding patterns for PRs and non-PRs, to ensure votes are distributed more efficiently. V28+ Vote Filtering Filters out vote duplicates early on during packet processing. V28+ Vote Rebroadcaster Filtering An index that tracks and filters vote rebroadcasts. Includes: tracking the top 100 reps by weight, per-rep history of recent votes &amp; block hashes, deduplicating by vote hash, minimum time interval between rebroadcasts of the same hash from the same rep.

For example, if an account with 1 XNO and another account with 5 XNO both make two transactions, Nano representatives will vote on one transaction from the 1 XNO bucket, and one transaction from the 5 XNO bucket, before voting on a second transaction from the same bucket. Furthermore, the least-recently-used account within a bucket has the most priority (in that bucket), so after an account makes a transaction it gets moved to the back of the line behind everyone else (in that bucket). This means that if an attacker tries to send thousands of transactions from an account that only has 0.00001 Nano (for example), other accounts in the 0.00001 bucket that don't make frequent transactions will have priority over the spam, and the 0.00001 bucket spam will have no impact on accounts in other balance-buckets (e.g. 1 XNO).</p> <p>Balance-based Buckets</p> <p>Prioritization buckets are split by account balances, not transaction amounts</p> <p>Prior to V24, there were 129 balance buckets<sup>3</sup>, with the majority (89) of those buckets being for balances under 0.0003. Since most legitimate users tend to have larger balances, most of these 89 balance buckets were minimally used. In V24 this was updated to 62 balance buckets<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>, &amp; account balances under 0.0003 shared the same bucket. This created more buckets around typical real-world account balances, helping prioritize legitimate transactions over spam. V27 added an additional bucket (\u04fe0.000001 to \u04fe0.0003) to account for common wallet and faucet minimums<sup>6</sup>.</p> <p>The following image illustrates the balance bucket &amp; least-recently-used prioritization process:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"protocol-design/spam-work-and-prioritization/#prioritization-buckets","title":"Prioritization buckets","text":"<p>Here are the 63 balance buckets in the reference node implementation, based on the V27 source code<sup>6</sup>.

These are only foundational updates and will not be configured for activation in this release. 2020-08-29 Epoch blocks Following the postponing of the Nano PoW algorithm in favor or research towards other options, the original epoch v2 blocks intended for the PoW algorithm update were modified for increasing work difficulty using the existing algorithm in V21.0 and subsequently distributed in August 2020. Any future PoW algorithm updates will require a different epoch block version. TBD Node release Nano node VXX.X released to include new PoW algorithm in PoW server and final changes allowing transition via epoch blocks.

For this reason the epoch blocks are being distributed to act as the marker in the ledger.</p> <p>Once epoch block distribution is started the ability to validate the new work difficulty levels is required. Since node versions before V21.0 do not have the ability to do this, they will be immediately de-peered from the network and cannot participate with the current network until upgraded.</p> <p>To mitigate the impacts of this approach the Nano Foundation will be communicating regularly about progress and monitoring closely the activity on the network. Once acceptable conditions exist to finalize the transition, the distribution will begin. The current plan is to start once over 90% of voting weight has been upgraded, along with all the key services on the network.</p> Recommended preparations <p>In order to best prepare for the transition to new thresholds, the following items should be considered:</p> <p>Work generation guide The new Work Generation guide was written to help users and integrations leverage their work generation at all times.</p> <p>Work validation The <code>work_validate</code> RPC has multiple changes to the response, one which will break most existing integrations when upgrading to V21, two others that will become useful after upgrade:</p> <ul> <li>If <code>difficulty</code> parameter is not explicitly passed in the request, the existing <code>valid</code> field will not be returned (breaking)</li> <li><code>valid_all</code> is a new return field, <code>true</code> if the work is valid at the current default difficulty (will go up after epoch upgrade)</li> <li><code>valid_receive</code> is a new return field, <code>true</code> if the work is valid at the lower epoch_2 receive difficulty (only useful after the epoch upgrade is finished)</li> <li>If possible, it is best to avoid using this RPC until the epoch upgrade is completed</li> </ul> <p>External work generation nano-work-server has been updated to use the higher threshold (<code>fffffff800000000</code>) by default when not given an explicit <code>difficulty</code>. The <code>work_validate</code> response has the same breaking changes as above.</p> <ul> <li>Prefer directly using the server as a work peer as outlined in the guide. The node always requests the appropriate difficulty threshold when using RPC block_create, or work_generate with the optional <code>block</code>.</li> <li>In cases where requesting directly from a node is not possible, avoid using the lower threshold for receive blocks (<code>fffffe0000000000</code>) until the epoch upgrade is fully complete.</li> </ul> <p>Work generation performance Testing out work generation capabilities on a machine is recommended. Details for how to accomplish this can be found in the Benchmark section of the Work Generation guide.</p> <p>Active difficulty changes The active difficulty RPC command and WebSocket topic allow programatically retrieving the current difficulty from the <code>network_minimum</code> field in the response. When this field changes from <code>ffffffc000000000</code> (pre-epoch v2 difficulty) to <code>fffffff800000000</code> (8x higher epoch v2 difficulty), it indicates the epoch upgrade has begun.</p> Post-distribution changes <p>Accounts that have already been upgraded can optionally use <code>fffffe0000000000</code> as the lower threshold for receive blocks going forward. The current epoch version of an opened account can be obtained using the <code>account_info</code> RPC, field <code>account_version</code>. Once that field has the value <code>\"2\"</code>, the lower threshold may be used.</p> <p>Other integration considerations Although it is already recommended as best practice, any integrations not already calling for the frontier block when constructing a transaction should do so. If hashes are being internally tracked and frontier is not requested, the integration could unintentionally cause a fork on the account with distribution of epoch blocks.</p> <p>See Step 1: Get Account Info for the <code>account_info</code> RPC recommendation when creating transactions.</p>"},{"location":"releases/network-upgrades/#state-blocks","title":"State blocks","text":"<p>Purpose</p> <p>The upgrade to state blocks involved multiple node releases and three different actions on the network including distribution of two canary blocks and the first epoch blocks.</p> <p>Transition Details</p> Date Type Description 2018-03-23 Node release Nano node V11.0 released with support for state blocks built-in but not yet activated. 2018-04-11 Canary block Parse canary block distributed which enabled parsing of state blocks by nodes so manual generation of that block type would be accepted on the network going forward.

Every account can freely choose a Representative at any time to vote on their behalf, even when the delegating account itself is offline. These Representative accounts are configured on nodes that remain online and vote on the validity of transactions they see on the network. Their voting weight is the sum of balances for accounts delegating to them, and if they have enough voting weight they become a Principal Representative. The votes these Principal Representatives send out will subsequently be rebroadcasted by other nodes.</p> <p>As these votes are shared and rebroadcasted between nodes, they are tallied up and compared against the online voting weight available. Once a node sees a block get enough votes to reach quorum, that block is confirmed. Due to the lightweight nature of blocks and votes, the network is able to reach confirmation for transaction ultrafast, often in under a couple seconds. Also note that delegation of voting weight does not mean staking of any funds - the account delegating can still spend all their available funds at any time without restrictions.</p> <p>Because Nano accounts can freely delegate their voting weight to representatives at any time, the users have more control over who has power with consensus and how decentralized the network is.

In order to function effectively, a currency must be easily transferable, non-reversible, and have limited or no fees. The increased transaction times, large fees, and questionable network scalability have raised questions about the practicality of Bitcoin as an everyday currency.</p> <p>In this paper, we introduce RaiBlocks, a low-latency cryptocurrency built on an innovative block-lattice data structure offering unlimited scalability and no transaction fees. RaiBlocks by design is a simple protocol with the sole purpose of being a high-performance cryptocurrency. The RaiBlocks protocol can run on low-power hardware, allowing it to be a practical, decentralized cryptocurrency for everyday use.</p> <p>Cryptocurrency statistics reported in this paper are accurate as of publication date.</p>"},{"location":"whitepaper/english/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>In 2008, an anonymous individual under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper outlining the world's first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin <sup>1</sup>. A key innovation brought about by Bitcoin was the blockchain, a public, immutable and decentralized data-structure which is used as a ledger for the currency's transactions. Unfortunately, as Bitcoin matured, several issues in the protocol made Bitcoin prohibitive for many applications:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Poor scalability: Each block in the blockchain can store a limited     amount of data, which means the system can only process so many     transactions per second, making spots in a block a commodity.     Currently the median transaction fee is $10.38 <sup>11</sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p>High latency: The average confirmation time is 164 minutes     <sup>12</sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Power inefficient: The Bitcoin network consumes an estimated     27.28TWh per year, using on average 260KWh per transaction     <sup>13</sup>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, function by achieving consensus on their global ledgers in order to verify legitimate transactions while resisting malicious actors. Bitcoin achieves consensus via an economic measure called Proof of Work (PoW). In a PoW system, participants compete in computing a number, called a nonce, such that the hash of the entire block is in a target range. This valid range is inversely proportional to the cumulative computation power of the entire Bitcoin network in order to maintain a consistent average time taken to find a valid nonce. The finder of a valid nonce is then allowed to add the block to the blockchain; therefore, those who exhaust more computational resources to compute a nonce play a greater role in the state of the blockchain. PoW provides resistance against a Sybil attack, where an entity behaves as multiple entities to gain additional power in a decentralized system, and also greatly reduces race conditions that inherently exist while accessing a global data-structure.</p> <p>An alternative consensus protocol, Proof of Stake (PoS), was first introduced by Peercoin in 2012 <sup>2</sup>. In a PoS system, participants vote with a weight equivalent to the amount of wealth they possess in a given cryptocurrency. With this arrangement, those who have a greater financial investment are given more power and are inherently incentivized to maintain the honesty of the system or risk losing their investment. PoS does away with the wasteful computation power competition, only requiring light-weight software running on low power hardware.</p> <p>The original RaiBlocks paper and first beta implementation were published in December, 2014, making it one of the first Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based cryptocurrencies <sup>3</sup>. Soon after, other DAG cryptocurrencies began to develop, most notably DagCoin/Byteball and IOTA <sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>. These DAG-based cryptocurrencies broke the blockchain mold, improving system performance and security. Byteball achieves consensus by relying on a \"main-chain\" comprised of honest, reputable and user-trusted \"witnesses\", while IOTA achieves consensus via the cumulative PoW of stacked transactions. RaiBlocks achieves consensus via a balance-weighted vote on conflicting transactions. This consensus system provides quicker, more deterministic transactions while still maintaining a strong, decentralized system. RaiBlocks continues this development and has positioned itself as one of the highest performing cryptocurrencies.</p>"},{"location":"whitepaper/english/#raiblocks-components","title":"RaiBlocks Components","text":"<p>Before describing the overall RaiBlocks architecture, we define the individual components that make up the system.</p>"},{"location":"whitepaper/english/#account","title":"Account","text":"<p>An account is the public-key portion of a digital signature key-pair.

Since addition is associative, the order the inputs are sequenced does not matter, and hence we simply need a global agreement. This is a key design component that converts a run-time agreement in to a design-time agreement. The receiving account has control over deciding which transfer arrived first and is expressed by the signed order of the incoming blocks.</p> <p>If an account wants to make a large transfer that was received as a set of many small transfers, we want to represent this in a way that fits within a UDP packet. When a receiving account sequences input transfers, it keeps a running total of its account balance so that at any time it has the ability to transfer any amount with a fixed size transaction. This differs from the input/output transaction model used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>Some nodes are uninterested in expending resources to store an account's full transaction history; they are only interested in each account's current balance.

Since agreements in RaiBlocks are reached quickly, on the order of milliseconds to seconds, we can present the user with two familiar categories of incoming transactions: settled and unsettled. Settled transactions are transactions where an account has generated receive blocks. Unsettled transactions have not yet been incorporated in to the receiver's cumulative balance.

If an attacker is able to gain over 50% of the voting strength, they can cause the network to oscillate consensus rendering the system broken. An attacker is able to lower the amount of balance they must forfeit by preventing good nodes from voting through a network DoS. RaiBlocks takes the following measures to prevent such an attack:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The primary defense against this type of attack is voting-weight     being tied to investment in the system. An account holder is     inherently incentivized to maintain the honesty of the system to     protect their investment. Attempting to flip the ledger would be     destructive to the system as a whole which would destroy their     investment.</p> </li> <li> <p>The cost of this attack is proportional to the market capitalization     of RaiBlocks. In PoW systems, technology can be invented that gives     disproportionate control compared to monetary investment and if the     attack is successful, this technology could be repurposed after the     attack is complete. With RaiBlocks the cost of attacking the system     scales with the system itself and if an attack were to be successful     the investment in the attack cannot be recovered.</p> </li> <li> <p>In order to maintain the maximum quorum of voters, the next line of     defense is representative voting. Account holders who are unable to     reliably participate in voting for connectivity reasons can name a     representative who can vote with the weight of their balance.     Maximizing the number and diversity of representatives increases     network resiliency.</p> </li> <li> <p>Forks in RaiBlocks are never accidental, so nodes can make policy     decisions on how to interact with forked blocks. The only time     non-attacker accounts are vulnerable to block forks is if they     receive a balance from an attacking account. Accounts wanting to be     secure from block forks can wait a little or a lot longer before     receiving from an account who generated forks or opt to never     receive at all. Receivers could also generate separate accounts to     use when receiving funds from dubious accounts in order to insulate     other accounts.</p> </li> <li> <p>A final line of defense that has not yet been implemented is block     cementing. RaiBlocks goes to great lengths to settle block forks     quickly via voting. Nodes could be configured to cement blocks,     which would prevent them from being rolled back after a certain     period of time. The network is sufficiently secured through focusing     on fast settling time to prevent ambiguous forks.</p> </li> </ol> <p>A more sophisticated version of a &gt;50\\% attack is detailed below. \"Offline\" is the percentage of representatives who have been named but are not online to vote. \"Stake\" is the amount of investment the attacker is voting with. \"Active\" is representatives that are online and voting according to the protocol. An attacker can offset the amount of stake they must forfeit by knocking other voters offline via a network DoS attack. If this attack can be sustained, the representatives being attacked will become unsynchronized, and this is demonstrated by \"Unsync.\" Finally, an attacker can gain a short burst in relative voting strength by switching their Denial of Service attack to a new set of representatives while the old set is re-synchronizing their ledger, this is demonstrated by \"Attack.\"</p> <p>If an attacker is able to cause Stake &gt;Active by a combination of these circumstances, they would be able to successfully flip votes on the ledger at the expense of their stake. We can estimate how much this type of attack could cost by examining the market cap of other systems. If we estimate 33% of representatives are offline or attacked via DoS, an attacker would need to purchase 33% of the market cap in order to attack the system via voting.</p>"},{"location":"whitepaper/english/#bootstrap-poisoning","title":"Bootstrap Poisoning","text":"<p>The longer an attacker is able to hold an old private-key with a balance, the higher the probability that balances that existed at that time will not have participating representatives because their balances or representatives have transferred to newer accounts. This means if a node is bootstrapped to an old representation of the network where the attacker has a quorum of voting stake compared to representatives at that point in time, they would be able to oscillate voting decisions to that node. If this new user wanted to interact with anyone besides the attacking node all of their transactions would be denied since they have different head blocks. The net result is nodes can waste the time of new nodes in the network by feeding them bad information. To prevent this, nodes can be paired with an initial database of accounts and known-good block heads; this is a replacement for downloading the database all the way back to the genesis block. The closer the download is to being current, the higher the probability of accurately defending against this attack. In the end, this attack is probably no worse than feeding junk data to nodes while bootstrapping, since they wouldn't be able to transact with anyone who has a contemporary database.</p>"},{"location":"whitepaper/english/#implementation","title":"Implementation","text":"<p>Currently, the reference implementation is implemented in C++ and has been producing releases since 2014 on Github <sup>7</sup>.</p>"},{"location":"whitepaper/english/#design-features","title":"Design Features","text":"<p>The RaiBlocks implementation adheres to the architecture standard outlined in this paper.
